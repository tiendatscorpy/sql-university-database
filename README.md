# SQL Database Design for an university

This is my Capstone project for **Database (CS-A1153)** course @Aalto University. The aim of this project is to design a SQL database for an university, which contains information about courses, rooms, room reservations, enrollments, and allows numerous SQL operations on the database. The constraints of the database can be found [here](Constraints.pdf). The [documentation](Documentation.pdf) justifies the choice of table designs, as well as explanations of SQL queries. 

## How to run

- Run the SQL/DB_creation.sql file to create necessary tables.
- Run the SQL/Queries.sql to run queries on the tables.
